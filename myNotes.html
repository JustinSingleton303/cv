      <strong><u>HTML</u></strong> is a mark up language used to give web pages their structure.
      Most webpages consist of more than just HTML these days, but HTML still
      has a very prominant role in the building of webpages online. Right now
      this page consists of just HTML.

    <strong><u>Tags</u></strong> are a very important part of the HTML language.  They help to
    define what is happening with the layout of the page, and can add stylistic
    features to the text.  For instance, the u tag underlines all the text
    within it.</font>
