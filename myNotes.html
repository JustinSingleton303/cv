  <h2>HTML Section</h2>
  <p>
    <font>
      <strong><u>HTML</u></strong> is a mark up language used to give web pages their structure.
      Most webpages consist of more than just HTML these days, but HTML still
      has a very prominant role in the building of webpages online. Right now
      this page consists of just HTML.
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font>
      <strong><u>Tags</u></strong> are a very important part of the HTML language. They help to
      define what is happening with the layout of the page, and can add stylistic
      features to the text. For instance, the "u" tag underlines all the text
      within it.
    </font>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong><u>HTML</u></strong></dt>
    <dd>
      This tag declares that the contents
      within is HTML code.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong><u>h1 through h6</u></strong></dt>
    <dd>This tag makes a header.
      Headers have bold text and the lower numbers "h1", for example,
      have larger sized text than the larger numbers, h6 having the
      smallest text.
    </dd>
    <dt><strong><u>a</u></strong></dt>
    <dd>This denotes an anchor tag.  These tags are good for placing
    links to other pages on the site and on the wider internet.</dd>
    <dt><strong><u>img</u></strong></dt>
    <dd>This tag is used to place images on the website.</dd>
  </dl>

  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font>
      <strong><u>Element</u></strong> An element is an individual component
      of an HTML document.
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font>
      <strong><u>Attribute</u></strong> An attribute is a characteristic of
      an HTML element that can be set or changed. Font size or color are
      examples of attributes in HTML.
    </font>
  </p>
  <p>
    <font>
      <strong><u>Style</u></strong> Style is an attribute within many elements
      used to set the visual aspects of the text within the tag having the style
      element within it.
      </style>
